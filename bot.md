# Building a Fauna and GPT-3.5 turbo Powered Chatbot: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Chatbots have revolutionized the way businesses interact with their customers, providing efficient and personalized assistance. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building a chatbot powered by FaunaDB and the OpenAI GPT-3.5 turbo model. By following the steps outlined below, you'll be able to create an intelligent chatbot that can engage in meaningful conversations with users. Let's get started!

## **Prerequisites**
To follow and fully understand this tutorial, you will need to have:
- Python 3.6 or a newer version.
- A text editor(VS code preferably).
- An understanding of Fauna and Telegram bots.

## **Step 1: Setting Up the Environment**
Before we begin, let's ensure that our development environment is properly set up. We'll need the following libraries:
- `telebot`: A Python library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API.
- `faunadb`: A Python driver for FaunaDB, a serverless cloud database.
- `openai`: A Python library for accessing the OpenAI models.
- `dotenv`: A Python library for loading environment variables from a .`env` file.
Make sure you have these libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install them:

```python
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI faunadb openai python-dotenv
```
Next, create a `.env` file in your project directory to store your environment variables. We'll use this file to store sensitive information like API keys. 

## **Step 2: Setting Up the Fauna database**
The first thing you need to get started with Fauna is to create an account on the official website. You can do that using either your email address or your github or netlify account here: [https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register](https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register)
We'd need the fauna database to store and retrieve user's messages for effective communication with our chatbot

## **Creating our database**
![Faunadasboard](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ck3os4m95j38scbxv1fu.png)
After creating our account with fauna, we will be creating a database to store our **Users** and **Messages**. Here we'd be asked for our database name and we are going to name it **MyChatBot** and our region is going to be set to **Classic** and like that we've created our database, easy rightðŸ˜Œ. Then, we should be presented with a screen like this one below:

![Faunahomepage](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kyip9gsquip0d4skytwg.png)

## **Creating our collection**
Next, we'd be creating our collections, which is basically **Tables** in the SQL world but with a twist in our context.

![Faunatable](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oszx2nkilcs7f84unqnd.png)
To create our Collection, click on the `Create Collection` button on the home page and give it a name, but since we'd be creating two collections we'd be naming them **Users** and **Messages**. The **Users** collection is for storing our user's data and ID from telegram, while the **Messages** collection is for storing the user's chat history with the bot. You will be asked for History `Days` and `TTL`. The History Days is used to define the number of days Fauna should retain a historical record of any data in that particular collection while the TTL serves as an expiry date for data in the collection. For example, if the TTL is set to 7, any data stored in that collection will be automatically deleted 7 days after its last modified date, but for this tutorial we'll not be needing it so it will be left untouched. After creating the two collections, we should be seeing this:
![FaunaCollection](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sqoenaqxuo11ugh8ilgo.png)

**Creating our Index**
Wondering what an Index isðŸ¤”?, Well an Index is simply a way to browse data in our collection more efficiently by organizing it based on specific fields or criteria, allowing for faster and targeted retrieval of information. To create our Index, we'll navigate to the Index tab and we should see something like this:

![FaunaIndex](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/utpp82tlf9064p8bwrwv.png)
To create our Index, we first of all need to **Select a Collection**, then specify our **Terms**, which is the specific data the Index is only allowed to browse. But for this tutorial we will be creating two Indexes, **users_by_id** which would be under our **Users** collection for registering users and **users_messages_by_username** which would be filtering our user's messages by their username. The **Terms** for **users_by_id** would be set to `data.user_id` while the **Terms** for **users_messages_by_username** will be set to `data.username`, then click `SAVE` to continue.

## **Getting our Database key**
Before we begin building a Python app that uses Fauna, we need to create an API key that would allow our application to easily communicate with our database. To create an API key, we need to navigate to the security tab on the Fauna sidebar (on the left side of the screen).

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/p689f53q4l8h4d0nv9wm.png)
Next, we are to click on the `NEW KEY` button that will navigate us to the page below:
![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5c7mib8nxpm5dxpmlffb.png)
Here, we would set our key role to **Server** instead of **Admin** and set our Key name to our database name which is optional, then click on `SAVE` and we'd be navigated to a page where our database key would be displayed and meant to be copied immediately. We should see something like this:
![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7x67gwtwqgwshp2yuxa5.png)
After getting the `API KEY`, store it in the `.env` file we created earlier in a `FAUNA_SECRET_KEY` variable.

## **Step 3: Creating our telegram bot**
A Telegram bot is an automated program that operates within the Telegram messaging platform. It is designed to interact with users and perform various tasks, such as providing information, delivering updates, answering queries, and executing commands. These bots are created using Telegram's Bot API and can be integrated into group chats or used in one-on-one conversations.

**Conversation with BotFather**

**BotFather** is an essential bot created by the developers of Telegram for creating and managing other bots on the Telegram platform. To interact with **BotFather**, we need to have a Telegram account. We can search for **"@BotFather"** in the Telegram app to initiate a conversation.

![Image description](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3fm6sgbv35v25m4ug90m.png)

**Conversation with BotFather**

To create a new bot with BotFather, we will use the **/newbot** and then supply the name of our bot and we'll then be given our bot `API KEY` which is the HTTP API access token in the image. We will the store our token key in our `.env` file in a `BOT_SECRET` variable. Now, we can now fully proceed to writing codeðŸ¤©.

![BotFather](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y1v0rvjtbr0hz8g88uvz.png)

## **Step 4: Importing necessary packages:**
As mentioned previously, we require certain packages to develop our bot. Now, we will proceed to import these packages.
```python
import telebot
from faunadb import query as q
from faunadb.objects import Ref
from faunadb.client import FaunaClient
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import json
import os
load_dotenv()
bot = telebot.TeleBot(os.getenv("BOT_SECRET"))
```
The `load_dotenv()` is to load our environment variables and the `bot = telebot.TeleBot(os.getenv("BOT_SECRET"))` is to create a bot object for our telegram bot.

## **Step 5: Creating our commands:**
Commands in Telegram bots are specific keywords or phrases that trigger the bot to perform a certain action or provide a specific response.  For instance, when we utilized the `/newbot`  command during our interaction with BotFather, it initiated a function that facilitated the creation of a new bot. Now, copy and paste the code down below:
```python
def chat(question, user):
    userid = user.from_user.id
    username = user.from_user.username
    return question

def image(prompt, user):
    userid = user.from_user.id
    return image

user_state = {}
@bot.message_handler(commands=['start'])
def start_message(message):
    user_id = message.from_user.id
    username = message.from_user.username
    bot.reply_to(message, "Hello")
@bot.message_handler(commands=['chat'])
def chat_message(message):
    # Set the user's state to 'help' and output a help message
    user_state[message.chat.id] = 'chat'
    bot.reply_to(message, "Hello, how may i help you: ")


@bot.message_handler(commands=['image'])
def image_message(message):
    # Set the user's state to 'help' and output a help message
    user_state[message.chat.id] = 'image'
    bot.reply_to(message, "What kind of image are you creating today: ")


@bot.message_handler(commands=['reset'])
def reset_message(message):
    # Set the user's state to 'help' and output a help message
    user_state[message.chat.id] = 'reset'
    bot.reply_to(message, "Resetting chat......... ")

@bot.message_handler(func=lambda message: True)
def echo_all(message):
    if message.chat.id in user_state and user_state[message.chat.id] == 'chat':
        chat_message = message.text
        user = message
        bot.reply_to(message, chat(chat_message, user))

    elif message.chat.id in user_state and user_state[message.chat.id] == 'start':
        user = message
        bot.reply_to(message, user)
        user_state[message.chat.id] = None

    elif message.chat.id in user_state and user_state[message.chat.id] == 'image':
        image_prompt = message.text
        user = message
        bot.reply_to(message, image(image_prompt, user))
        user_state[message.chat.id] = 'image'
        bot.send_message(message.chat.id, "What Image are you creating again?")

    elif message.chat.id in user_state and user_state[message.chat.id] == 'reset':
        chat_reset = message.text
        bot.reply_to(message, reset())
        user_state[message.chat.id] = None


bot.polling()
```
Now, let's now go through the functionalities of the code above
The bot responds to user commands such as `/start`, `/chat`and `/image`, while maintaining the conversation state for each user using the user_state dictionary. Upon receiving the `/start` command, the bot sends a **"Hello"** reply and resets the user's state. Similarly, when the `/chat` command is received, the bot asks how it can help and sets the user's state to **'chat'**. In the case of the `/image` command, the bot prompts the user for the type of image and sets the state to **'image'**. For any other messages, the bot checks the user's state and responds accordingly, such as echoing the message in the **'chat'** state, requesting the image prompt again in the **'image'** state, providing user information and resetting the state in the **'start'** state. The bot continuously listens for incoming messages using bot.polling().

## **Step 5: Updating our commands**
The code provided in step 4 was only a small portion of our chatbot implementation. Presently, we will be enhancing our code to develop a fully operational chatbot.

**The `/start` command**
The `/start` command will serve as the initial entry point for our chatbot. It will verify whether a user exists in our faunadb **User** collection using the `users_by_id` index we created earlier, and if not, it will add the user to the **User** collection and then send a message that will redirect the user to our `/chat` which handles our chat functionalities. This process involves retrieving the user's username and ID from our Telegrambot API. The updated code:
```python
@bot.message_handler(commands=['start'])
def start_message(message):
    client = FaunaClient(
        secret=os.getenv('FAUNA_SECRET_KEY')
    )
    user_id = message.from_user.id
    username = message.from_user.username
    user_exists = client.query(
        q.exists(q.match(q.index("users_by_id"), user_id)))
    if not user_exists:
        client.query(
            q.create(
                q.collection("Users"),
                {
                    "data": {
                        "user_id": user_id,
                        "username": username
                    }
                }
            )
        )
    bot.reply_to(message, "ðŸŒ¿ðŸ¤– Hello! Welcome to the fauna and gpt3 powered bot! ðŸŒŸðŸ’«\nTo begin, type /chat or click on it")
```

**The `/chat` command**
To create our chatbot, we will first create a faunadb client using the FaunaClient class and our secret key from an environment variable. Then, we will prepare a data object containing the username and the user's question, and insert it into the **Messages** collection in FaunaDB.

Next, we will retrieve the previous messages associated with the username by executing an index query. This query will retrieve all documents from the **Messages** collection that match the username, and we will extract the content of each message and store them in a list called "messages".

After that, we will set up the OpenAI API by configuring the API key from an environment variable. We will also define the persona of the assistant within a system message.

Then, we will construct the conversation prompt by combining the system message, user messages, and assistant messages from the `messages` list. We will use this conversation prompt to generate a response from the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, and then extract the generated reply from the API response.

We will then prepare the data for the assistant's reply and insert it into the **Messages** collection within FaunaDB. Finally, we will return the generated reply as the output of our chatbot.

```python
def prompt(username, question):
    # Create a FaunaDB client
    client = FaunaClient(secret=os.getenv('FAUNA_SECRET_KEY'))
    data = {
        "username": username,
        "message": {
            "role": "user",
            "content": question
        }
    }
    result = client.query(
        q.create(
            q.collection("Messages"),
            {
            "data": data
            }
        )
    )
    index_name = "users_messages_by_username"
    username = username
    # Paginate over all the documents in the collection using the index
    result = client.query(
        q.map_(
            lambda ref: q.get(ref),
            q.paginate(q.match(q.index(index_name), username))
        )
    )

    messages = []

    for document in result['data']:
        message = document['data']['message']
        messages.append(message)

    # Set up OpenAI API
    openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_SECRET_KEY')

    # Define the assistant's persona in a system message
    system_message = {"role":"system", "content" : "A helpful assistant that provides accurate information."}

    # Construct the conversation prompt with user messages and the system message
    prompt_with_persona = [system_message] + [
        {"role": "user", "content": message["content"]} if message["role"] == "user"
        else {"role": "assistant", "content": message["content"]} for message in messages
    ]

    # Generate a response from the model
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=prompt_with_persona
    )

    # Extract the generated reply from the API response
    generated_reply = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    
    newdata = {
        "username": username,
        "message": {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": generated_reply
        }
    }
    result = client.query(
        q.create(
            q.collection("Messages"),
            {
            "data": newdata
            }
        )
    )

    return generated_reply
```
If the user exists, the preceding steps will take place, which is why we created a prompt function to handle this scenario. In our chat function, if the user exists, the prompt function is executed. However, if the user does not exist, they are redirected back to the `/start` command in order to register them. The updated chat function:

```python
def chat(question, user):
    client = FaunaClient(
        secret=os.getenv('FAUNA_SECRET_KEY')
    )
    global chat_list
    userid = user.from_user.id
    username = user.from_user.username
    user_exists = client.query(
        q.exists(q.match(q.index("users_by_id"), userid)))
    if user_exists:
        reply = prompt(username, question)
        return reply
    else:
        return "ðŸŒ¿ðŸ¤– Hello! Welcome to the fauna and gpt3 powered bot! ðŸŒŸðŸ’«\nThis user is not logged in , type /start or click on it to login"
```
**The `/image` command**
The `/image` command is utilized to transform user text into images. Here's how it operates: First, it verifies if the user exists in the database. If the user exists, it proceeds to generate and return the image url output using the openAI Dall-E 2 model. The updated code:
```python
def image(prompt, user):
    client = FaunaClient(
        secret=os.getenv('FAUNA_SECRET_KEY')
    )
    userid = user.from_user.id
    openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_SECRET_KEY')
    user_exists = client.query(
        q.exists(q.match(q.index("users_by_id"), userid)))
    if user_exists:
        generated_image = openai.Image.create(
            prompt=prompt,
            n=1,
            size="1024x1024"
        )
        image_url = generated_image['data'][0]['url']
        return image_url
    else:
        return "ðŸŒ¿ðŸ¤– Hello! Welcome to the fauna and gpt3 powered bot! ðŸŒŸðŸ’«\nThis user is not logged in , type /start or click on it to login"
```
Having completed the necessary implementations, it is now time to put our bot to the test and ensure its full functionality.
