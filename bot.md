1) We started by configuring our chatbot( SHow video on how to do it)

2) Imported my libraries

3) Defining our bot functions

4) writing the first tests

5) Create two collections named users and messages. So the user collection holds the data for the user and their personal data, while the messages contain their inditheir telvidual messages with the chatbot

6) create an index user_message_by_username to query user messages using their username that we will retrieve from their telegram profile
